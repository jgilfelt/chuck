Chuck
=====

Chuck is a simple in-app HTTP inspector for Android OkHttp clients. Chuck intercepts and persists all HTTP requests and responses inside your application, and provides a UI for inspecting their content.

Apps using Chuck will display a notification showing a summary of ongoing HTTP activity. Tapping on the notification launches the full Chuck UI. Apps can optionally suppress the notification, and launch the Chuck UI directly from within their own interface. HTTP interactions and their contents can be exported via a share intent.

The main Chuck activity is launched in its own task, allowing it to be displayed alongside the host app UI using Android 7.x multi-window support.

Chuck requires Android 4.1+ and OkHttp 3.x.

**Warning**: The data generated and stored when using this interceptor may contain sensitive information such as Authorization or Cookie headers, and the contents of request and response bodies. It is intended for use during development, and not in release builds or other production deployments.

Setup
-----

Add the dependency in your `build.gradle` file. Add it alongside the `no-op` variant to isolate Chuck from release builds as follows:

```gradle
 dependencies {
   debugCompile 'com.readystatesoftware.chuck:library:1.0.4'
   releaseCompile 'com.readystatesoftware.chuck:library-no-op:1.0.4'
 }
```

In your application code, create an instance of `ChuckInterceptor` (you'll need to provide it with a `Context`, because Android) and add it as an interceptor when building your OkHttp client:

```java
OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
  .addInterceptor(new ChuckInterceptor(context))
  .build();
```

That's it! Chuck will now record all HTTP interactions made by your OkHttp client. You can optionally disable the notification by calling `showNotification(false)` on the interceptor instance, and launch the Chuck UI directly within your app with the intent from `Chuck.getLaunchIntent()`.

FAQ
---

- Why are some of my request headers missing?
- Why are retries and redirects not being captured discretely?
- Why are my encoded request/response bodies not appearing as plain text?

Please refer to [this section of the OkHttp wiki](https://github.com/square/okhttp/wiki/Interceptors#choosing-between-application-and-network-interceptors). You can choose to use Chuck as either an application or network interceptor, depending on your requirements.
